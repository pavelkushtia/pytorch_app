# PyTorch Hello World

A simple PyTorch application that demonstrates basic neural network functionality. This example creates a simple neural network that learns to fit a linear relationship between input and output data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.2.0+
- NumPy 1.24.0+
- Matplotlib 3.7.0+

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the main script:
```bash
python hello_pytorch.py
```

This will create a simple neural network, train it on some synthetic data, and display the results.
